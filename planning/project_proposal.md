# Project Proposal

Pod Members: Ethan Pineda, Richmond Akondo, Nathnael Mekonnen

## Problem Statement

Addressing the psychological challenges faced by immigrants is a pressing need in today's globalized society. Transitioning to a new country is an overwhelming experience, often accompanied by cultural shock, language barriers, and the longing for familiar support systems. This is the crux of the problem that the project, HomeHeart, plans to solve.

## Description

HomeHeart is envisioned as an online platform, and will be designed specifically to cater to the unique mental health needs of immigrants. It will facilitate connections with mental health professionals from their home countries, allowing therapeutic interactions in the comfort of their native language. This familiarity, I believe, can play a significant role in promoting mental wellness.
	In the context of the United States, a country that is home to a large immigrant population, the need for such a service is even more pronounced. The professionals enlisted on our platform will be meticulously verified and registered, ensuring reliable and quality care for the targeted users.
	One of the key features of HomeHeart is its affordability. By leveraging the economic disparities between the US and many immigrants' home countries, we can offer these vital services at a price point that is accessible for many more people. So, It's a win-win situation - immigrants receive affordable, personalized, and culturally-sensitive mental health services, while the professionals in their home countries gain access to a broader client base and money.
I believe if my pod can build HomeHeart.org, we can support immigrants but also uplift mental health professionals in their home countries, fostering a global network of care that transcends geographical boundaries.
