* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)
yes

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?
yes

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The medifical professionals view. If this is still at risk, then we would need to change somee things about our presentation.
